# Evaluation-Criteria

In this repo, we will publish the evaluation criteria for our research. The criteria published here will be used in all our research reports evaluating vendors. We encourage you to do a pull request if you think this list is missing something or something needs to be changed. We expect both vendors and end users to contribute to this repo so that the criteria published here serve as the blueprint for end users wanting to evaluate various vendor products. We are in the initial stages of bringing openness to enterprise market research and our strategy will evolve over time towards more openness.
